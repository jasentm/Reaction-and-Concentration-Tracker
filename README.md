# DnDBeyond Reaction and Concentration Tracker
A reaction and concentration tracker userscript for [DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com)

Keeping track of concentration and if you've used your reaction this round can be difficult, especially during high-level combat.  
Be your DMs new favorite player by keeping track of them yourself!

## Features
* 2 simple check boxes added to your dndbeyond character sheet for concentration and reaction
* A built-in alert asking for a concentration check when you take damage and are maintaining concentration
  * The tracker will even calculate the DC for you!
* Checked boxes will persist even if the page is reloaded or navigated away from
* Boxes will also remain checked (or unchecked) per character

## How To Use

1. Install a userscript extension of your choice. I personally use [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) in Google Chrome.
2. Install the userscript from [DnDBeyondReactionConcentration.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasentm/Reaction-and-Concentration-Tracker/main/DnDBeyondReactionConcentration.js)
3. Navigate to your character page and it should work!

## Notes/Acknowledgements/Known Issues
* If you use this and want additional features or find that something doesn't work, please let me know!
* This entire idea was inspired by mwr247's [DnDBeyondSpellPoints](https://github.com/Mwr247/DnDBeyondSpellPointsV2/tree/main) - I would have never even known that userscripts were a thing without it!
* I have, on more than one occasion while building this userscript, encountered a page on DnDBeyond asking for me to click and hold on a button to prove I am human - this may or may not happen to you while using this tracker
